AdvancedAntiVPN is a minecraft plugin which aims to block players using proxies from joining your server
# How does it work?
The plugin uses an external API (https://api.iprisk.info/v1/) alongside a customisable list of blocked addresses to check for disallowed IPs. 
# Features
* Block proxy IPs from joining your server
* Results from the API are cached for maximum performance
* Block proxy IPs from pinging your server (to block server scanners) (requires [PacketEvents](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/packetevents-api.80279/) installed)
